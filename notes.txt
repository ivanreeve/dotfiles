- baseline input lvl is 15

FIX: CCLS on Ubuntu v22.04, Mint Cinnamon 23.1, 'iostream' file not found...

- ccls uses the outdated clang that shipped with my distro, so i installed new using sudo apt install clang @ 123mb it installed depedencies like llvm as well
- tried to compile using clang, got errors about a missing -lstdc++ flag
- i thought ccls uses gcc but used clang. updated clang, created symlink libstdc++.so -> libstdc++.so.6.
- probably because ccls tries to load libstdc++.so but can't find it that a symlink worked.
